Machine Learning - Subset of AI , It provides stats tools to analyse,visualize,predict,forecast the data.

Deep Learning - Subset of Machine learning , to memic the human brain. 

Data Science - overlapping maths,stats,Machine learning,Deep Learning. 

Equation of a Line -
y=mx+c
y=beta 0 + beta 1 * x
ax+by+c = 0 

m= slope = with unit movement of x axis,how much movement is there in y axis
c = intercept = when x=0 , where does the straight line meet the y axis

if two features x1,x2 
w1x1 + w2x2 + b = 0 where w1,w2 are co-efficient 
wTx+b =0 

if 3D Plane , 
w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + b = 0

if n Dimensional plane,
w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 +.....+ wnxn + b =0

Equation of a straight line passing through an origin is given by , 
w1x1 + w2x2 + b = 0 
w1x1 + w2x2 + 0  = 0
w1x1 + w2x2 = 0
wTx = 0
                                                  
Equation of a n dimensional plane / Hyperplane ,

^                     ^
||n : wTx = 0 , where || is known as pi or plane

w = w1      x=   x1
    w2           x2
    w3           x3   
    .     *       .
    .  .
    .             .
    wn           xn

  -->dot product
w * x = wTx = ||w|| * ||x|| cos teta = 0
